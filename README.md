# JPortal + Elective Swap

This fork of **[JPortal](https://github.com/J2V-k/jportal-vhost)** integrates **ElectiveXchange**, enabling students to access the elective swap platform directly from the portal.

## Features

* **Seamless Integration:** ElectiveXchange is embedded via an iframe for smooth navigation.
* **Direct Access:** Navigate to `/electivexchange` within the portal.
* **Standalone Platform:** Also accessible directly at [ElectiveXchange](https://electivexchange.vercel.app/).
* **Authentication & Theme Maintained:** Original JPortal login and theme functionality remain intact.

This integration provides a unified experience, allowing students to view and swap electives efficiently without leaving the portal.
